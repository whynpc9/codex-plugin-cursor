description: Run a Codex code review against local git state
---

Run a Codex review through the shared built-in reviewer.

Raw slash-command arguments:
`$ARGUMENTS`

Core constraint:
- This command is review-only.
- Do not fix issues, apply patches, or suggest that you are about to make changes.
- Your only job is to run the review and return Codex's output verbatim to the user.

Execution mode rules:
- If the raw arguments include `--wait`, do not ask. Run the review in the foreground.
- If the raw arguments include `--background`, do not ask. Run the review in a background shell.
- Otherwise, estimate the review size before asking:
  - For working-tree review, start with `git status --short --untracked-files=all`.
  - For working-tree review, also inspect both `git diff --shortstat --cached` and `git diff --shortstat`.
  - For base-branch review, use `git diff --shortstat <base>...HEAD`.
  - Treat untracked files or directories as reviewable work even when `git diff --shortstat` is empty.
  - Only conclude there is nothing to review when the relevant working-tree status is empty or the explicit branch diff is empty.
  - Recommend waiting only when the review is clearly tiny, roughly 1-2 files total and no sign of a broader directory-sized change.
  - In every other case, including unclear size, recommend background.
  - When in doubt, run the review instead of declaring that there is nothing to review.
- Then ask the user once to choose between waiting for results or running in the background, putting the recommended option first.

Argument handling:
- Preserve the user's arguments exactly.
- Do not strip `--wait` or `--background` yourself.
- Do not add extra review instructions or rewrite the user's intent.
- `/codex:review` is native-review only. It does not support staged-only review, unstaged-only review, or extra focus text.
- If the user needs custom review instructions or more adversarial framing, they should use `/codex:adversarial-review`.

Supported arguments: `[--wait|--background] [--base <ref>] [--scope auto|working-tree|branch]`

Foreground flow:
- Run:
```bash
node "$CURSOR_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/codex-companion.mjs" review $ARGUMENTS
```
- Return the command stdout verbatim, exactly as-is.
- Do not paraphrase, summarize, or add commentary before or after it.
- Do not fix any issues mentioned in the review output.

Background flow:
- Launch the review in a background shell (with block_until_ms set to 0 or equivalent):
```bash
node "$CURSOR_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/codex-companion.mjs" review $ARGUMENTS
```
- After launching the command, tell the user: "Codex review started in the background. Check `/codex:status` for progress."
